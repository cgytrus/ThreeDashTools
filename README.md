# **THIS PROJECT IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED!**
thank you to everyone who checked it out, this is probably one of my biggest projects yet, however i haven't really felt like working on this project for a while now but i kept it up as long as it was working, which i thought would be forever until the game updated *after the developer publicly announced there will be no more updates*, and since i *still* don't feel like working on this project, and don't think i ever will at this point, i have to archive the repo

you're still free to fork it and countine working on your own if you wish but i will not be affiliated with anything other people do

if you wanna follow me and my future projects, such as games and mods for other games, you can find my socials [here](https://cgyt.ru)

thank u all <3
